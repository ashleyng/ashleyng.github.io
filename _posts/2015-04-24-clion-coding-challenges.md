title: Clion and coding challenges

{{ page.title }}
=============

As of a few days ago, CLion 1.0 has been released!!!!! I downloaded it and I'm super excited to finally have it for real. If you didn't already know, I prefer CLion over Xcode for normal programing (i.e. not iOS development), and did a short review of it a while ago. I think this will help tremendously next semester because I'll possibly be taking two classes that are C++ based and I won't have to use Xcode or compile from the terminal every time.

I had mentioned some coding challenges awhile ago (I think it was Cracking the Coding Interview and/r/dailyprogrammer). I've been doing a bit more of them recently, and I have found some other sites that I wanted to share.  First one is checkio.org, which is strictly python. It's more of a progression site where you unlock areas as you complete more challenges in a certain area. Another site is CodeEval. This site doesn't restrict your language like checkio does. The site seems to be geared towards showing how good you are. You have a profile that people (and employers) can go look at, and it tells you how many challenges you've done as well as how many of each difficulty you've done. Another site I've used is HackerRank. HackerRank in my opinion is a more popular CodeEval. I don't actually remember how I found CodeEval, but I had to do a coding challenge for a company through HackerRank. Out of all of these, I probably use HackerRank the most.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
