title: Quick and short Komodo Edit vs. Aptana

==============

As I said in a previous post I've been using Komodo Edit and Aptana for my Murach books. This is just a quick update on that (it's more of to get my opinions written down because I'd probably forget by the time I do the full review). I'll do a final review once I finish the JavaScript Murach book.

At this moment I think I'd prefer Komodo's looks over Aptana, but Aptana's features over Komodo's. Komodo has a very clean look to it, you can even choose the icons you use as well as text color. You can also change the text color in Aptana, but you have to do it individually while Komodo just has themes you can quickly pick. I haven't written much HTML or CSS in Komodo yet, but both programs' autocomplete for those are pretty good. Although I think Aptana adds the end tag automatically for you while Komodo doesn't. One thing I absolutely love about Aptana is that it autocompletes file names for you when you're typing in source location.

On a closing note, I really want to try JetBrains WebStorm. It looks awesome and I've read some really good reviews, and with the academic license, it's a really good price. I'm somewhat willing to buy it, butI think the thing holding me back is the thought of "What if I don't like it? I just wasted $30 dollars on this".

Well that's all for now. Look for my full review in the future!

Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night where ever you may be.
