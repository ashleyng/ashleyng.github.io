title: Clion update
---

So I started to use [CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) to do a few coding challenges on [/r/dailyprogrammer](http://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/wiki/challenges), and as a JetBrains product, I love it! But there are a few things I'd suggest they fix, or just stuff I need to look into more to change. So first off, there is no C++ template file. Such as what you should have for a main.cpp file. So I had to create my own temple which was pretty simple, but for some reason it doesn't include my #include in the template. So I always have "#include <iostream>" in my files, but when I choose to create a C++ file from my template, it will just have "<iostream>". Next, is that it only supports CMake, which is pretty simple to pick if you just look at the CMake file it generates for you. But I think it would be better if they allowed for other types of make files. One reason I prefer CLion over XCode, is that it allows me to keep all my files in the same folder and just change the make file. While I believe in XCode, I would have to create new projects for each challenge I do and it would make my directory look really ugly.

Overall, the only JetBrains product I've come across that I don't really like is their Java IDE, but then again, I don't really code in Java. But if you like other JetBrains products, you'll be happy with CLion.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good night, and Happy New Years!
