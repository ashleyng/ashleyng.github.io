title: School update

Thought I'd give you guys an update since I'm kind of unmotivated to do any sort of work at the moment.

So we're in our first full week of class this week. There's really nothing spectacular going on. Just normal class days and morning workouts. Our football team still isn't doing so hot, but we've only had two games, so maybe we'll improve?

The computer vision class is a lot of fun and really interesting. We're working on our first group project which is panoramic stitching. It seems pretty simple at the moment, but we haven't learned everything for the project yet. We're using opencv and python for this class, which are both pretty easy to pick up. My only gripe would be that opencv's documentation isn't the best. So you can use C, C++, and python for opencv, but pretty much all the examples you see of the functions are either in C and C++. So that makes it hard to understand how to properly call a function sometimes. Opencv does have quite a lot of tutorials, which is super helpful. I may post some of the pictures we get from our program on here, because the extra credit part of our assignment is pretty cool.

We got our first programming assignment for my Intro into Computer Security class, and I'm kind of scared. From his instructions, it sounds like he wants us to make several classes for this assignment. As well as some pretty intense functions, at least they sound that way to me. Also I haven't coded in Java like this since Data Structures, which was about 2 years ago. So I'm going to have to go through a WHOLE lot of relearning, as well as do it super fast O.O

The career fair is next week, and I'm nervous and excited about it at the same time. Even though I'm a 5th year, this will be the first career fair I've attended. So hopefully I don't make a fool of myself, and can find some interesting companies to intern at or get a job at. I'll probably give an update to that once it's passed, but until then, I'm just going to psych myself out about.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
