=================

We'll where to begin!

My name is Ashley and I'm currently studying computer science. The main reason I made this is to give updates on current projects I'm working on and possible how school is going a such. I've done a similar blog for a Software Engineering course and this is where I got the inspiration for this blog. This blog may not exclusively be about my projects and school life. I do have other hobbies such as; rock climbing, collecting and building Lego, writing poems, Rubik's style puzzles, and building and maintaining an EDC (every day carry) and a bug out bag. My post could vary from  doing reviews on a pocket knife or flashlight, what my EDC is for the day, my new Rubik's cube or Lego set, poems I've written and feel like sharing, or just really what every I feel like posting about.

We'll this first post is more of a preface to the blog and may just be copied to the about page of this blog. My first actual post may be in a few hours or days. I will actually go start righting it right after I post this.

Good Morning, Good Afternoon, Good evening, and Good night where ever you maybe!

Ashley
