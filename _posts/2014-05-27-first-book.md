=================

We'll I just completed all the all exercises in Murach's HTML5 and CSS3 book. I guess you could say this will be a review on the book.

So the first two section of this book mainly covered HTML and CSS, then there was a section on JavaScript and JQuery, and the last section was all about actually deploying a website (which I actually haven't read yet). Before this book, I had some knowledge on CSS and HTML (but somewhat minimal), and pretty much no knowledge on JavaScript and JQuery. Maybe HTML and CSS are just very easy languages to learn or it may of been from my prior knowledge, but I felt that the exercises were very easy and simple. Even though it took me about five days to complete the book, I probably could of done it in a day if I really wanted to. The JavaScript and JQuery section I found a bit more interesting and actually read through some of the chapters, but I didn't quite enjoy the exercises as much. I felt like the exercises were more of a copy what you see in the book and mess with numbers to get formatting right. This book has increased my knowledge on the subject, but I would only recommend it to beginners and nothing more; anything above and you probably won't learn a whole lot.

But with the knowledge I gained from the book, I plan on updating my github.io site and I have this idea for a mock site thatI don't intend to deploy it, it would just be something for me to mess around with. Now my idea is for a new routes log for my local climbing wall. It would have a form where you input information about the route such as; difficulty, where it's located in the gym, who set it, and the color tape and pattern used. There will be pages/tables for all the new routes, all current routes up, and all routes about to be taken down. One of the tricky parts I foresee at the moment is working with color selection and pattern selection for the tape because of the way I'd like to have it function, but we'll see how it goes.

Now that I've finished this book, my next book is Murach's JavaScript and JQuery book. Up till know, I've been using AptanaStudio3 for the first book, but I think I'm going to switch to Komodo Edit 8 for this next book. I will probably do a comparison when I'm done with the JavaScript and JQuery book so be on the lookout for that.

Well that's all I got for this entry,

Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night where ever you may be!
