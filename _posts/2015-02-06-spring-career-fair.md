title: Spring career fair
---

Well the career fair this semester snuck up on me, it was yesterday, but I think it went well. I'd say probably better than last semesters. It was definitely a lot smaller, but maybe that will help recruiters remember me. I'm going to try and get all my applications into all the companies by Sunday night, and hopefully I get an internship out of one of them. I'm pretty excited about a few of them so hopefully I at least get interviews with them. I think at this point I need to go all in and just kind of apply everywhere because I really need to get some sort of internship for the summer. But this was just a short up date about the career fair.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
