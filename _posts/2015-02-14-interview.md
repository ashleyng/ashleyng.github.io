=============

As you may remember, I had my career fair last week (actually, now that I think about it, I'm not sure I told y'all about that. If I didn't... I had a career fair about a week ago). Since then, I've applied to a few different companies/positions. I don't want to give to much away because I don't want to jinx anything, and I am thinking of doing a big post about the companies I applied to, ones I had interviews with, and (hopefully) ones I got offers from (as long as I didn't sign an NDA). But I do have a few interviews scheduled, so lets hope things go well and that I at least get one offer.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
