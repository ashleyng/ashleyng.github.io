title: Best programming languages?
category: notable
---

I know I've mentioned that I was going to use Python and C++ as my main programing languages, but a few days ago while doing some practice interview questions, I thought, "is this really the right move? Should I be using something different". So this brought me to look up "best programming languages" on google. I looked at 5 promising and pretty recent articles, and to be honest, I haven't read them, I just looked at the rankings they gave. But here are the links if you wish to look into them: [udemy](https://blog.udemy.com/best-programming-language/), [mashable](http://mashable.com/2014/01/21/learn-programming-languages/), [businessinsider](http://www.businessinsider.com/best-tech-skills-resume-ranked-salary-2014-11), [sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/best-programming-language-learn-2014-mid-year-update/), [forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/07/14/what-is-the-most-valuable-programming-language-to-know-for-the-future-and-why/). It seems to be a consensus that the best programming languages, in no particular order, are: C, C++, Java, C#, JavaScript, Python. These six were in all 5 articles as well as being pretty high up in their list, but I guess that's really no surprise since they are pretty much the major programming languages, and not really obscure or not well known like Scala or Go. Objective-C was also pretty high up in a few of the articles, but that's probably because of iOS and OS app development. I wonder how Objective-C will fair in a few months as more people start to move to Swift? But after looking at the articles, I think I've made a pretty good choice in programming languages. Not to mention that I'm registered for a JavaScript and Objective-C class.

Well, until next time. Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
