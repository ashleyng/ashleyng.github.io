title: Almost done!

Sorry, I've been absent lately. I've just hit that point in the semester where I have a ton of projects going on, but on the plus side, Thanksgiving is only 2 weeks away! Then after that, there's only 1 week of school left before finals!

I've been attending my Uni's iOS and web development workshops lately. The iOS one isn't that well structured so I haven't learned a whole lot, but the web dev one is really great. He always has a plan and has slides for everything he's going to cover. Hopefully both of the workshops will really help me improve in both areas. But last time in the iOS class we talked and worked on our own projects, so I kind of pitched my idea to him which is a mobile app for my computer vision final project. So the project is sort of route identification for a climbing wall. It's pretty much exactly like the star gazing app, but for routes on a rock wall. Even though I'm not sure if we'll even be able to complete the CV project in the time we have left, I'd really like to continue it and work on making the app for it. While talking to him though, I've realized something about myself. He had asked me if this is something I'd work on at a hack night, and I said, 'Yea, maybe, possibly,... probably". And I was about to tell him that I kind of stop working on projects if I'm stuck and can't figure out where to go next. I was kind of shocked that I hadn't really noticed this about myself till right then, but I really hope to improve on this by attending hack nights or just talking to the iOS people who run the workshops on advice and stuff.

I've also have a research paper for my classical civilizations class, and my topic is kind of comparing the disorder of the city with the reign of emperors and the temples built during their time. To present this topic effectively I have to have a visual timeline, so I think I'm going to try and make a VERY simple, static website to display the timeline and my paper. In my software engineering class, we used a timeline tool, and I'm going to be using the same one, except I'll be using a google doc instead of using an API. Here's the link for the timeline tool I'll be using.

Well I should get back to work,

Until next time,  good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
