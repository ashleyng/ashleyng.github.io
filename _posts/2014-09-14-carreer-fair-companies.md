==========

Well, I wasn't getting anywhere on my C++ program so I decided to take a break and look into the career fair companies. This has made me even more excited to go and talk to them and apply for internships. I'm still pretty scared about technical interviews though. What ever happened to just asking, "What is your biggest weakness?". Anyways, it seems like I have a high interest in the space and defense category/fields. Although I don't really know what I'd actually be doing there or even really know what sort of field I want to go in. I just think the space and defense companies sound super fun and cool to work for.

Well this was just a quick little update, be on the lookout for a post-career fair post after Thursday.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening and good night
