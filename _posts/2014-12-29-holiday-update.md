Just a quick update. I haven't been doing much since Christmas eve. Since my dad has been off work, I usually spend time with him. I normally only work on my projects when he's at work. So I haven't gotten much done since my last update. I've been trying to do cylindrical projections on my pano project but I haven't made much progress. I'm having issues on which method to use. There's the, I guess normal method, and the inverse, and there's really no consensus on which method is better or easier out of the papers/sites I've read. It's kind of been 50/50 on which method they use or they just don't explain it very well on how to do it. But either way, it seems like I have to go pixel by pixel to do cylindrical project.

There's a lot of other stuff I'd like to get started on before winter break ends, like; getting a head start in my OS class by reading the text book and relearning C, reading and doing coding challenges in "Cracking the Coding Interview" book, and doing more challenges at /r/dailyprogrammer. Which I guess I'll get started on as soon as I finish reading "The Blood of Olympus".

Well that's all for now. Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
