============

Yesterday my BC group presented to the class I'm proctoring because they're going to be doing a similar project. So we were just showing them what we've done over the summer and talked about our Data model. But we have a lot of progress from when we first started. We've even done some features that I never would of thought possible, and our application looks really well done. We were talking about continuing this project in the fall, just to put the final touches and make sure it gets to the customer with all the features they want. And I was just thinking maybe get another CS credit out of the way. It would definitely lighten my stress since this will probably (80% sure) be the last year I'll be able to receive financial aid.

Also, I think I'm pretty much done with the OC database. I just need to meet with them to get feedback and such. Make a few updates, and then I think I'll write some sort of documentation for the RecSports software developer. Although, I don't really know if I'll actually be implementing this anymore because I'm not really sure if I'm still on good terms with the OC supervisors/directors since I left the job... but we'll wait and see. Whether it get's implemented or not, I still have the APEX app to put on my resume.

Proctoring has been super busy with grading and such, so not a whole lot of time for side projects, but I really wish I could of done this again for the fall. But I know I will need to focus on Algorithms. Hopefully my load will be lighter in the spring, or may be I'll be able to proctor for the class again next summer (if I don't get an internship, or decide to go into the military).

So dynamic applications. I had to build one for a software engineering class I think Fall 2013? But either way, it was my very first upper division CS class, which was a VERY BAD IDEA. The only way I got into that class was because I had an early registration time because of all the extra hours I had accumulated from when I was a physics major. I didn't really understand what we were coding, I had minimal HTML/CSS knowledge at the time, I had never built any kind of application like this before, I had no back-end experience, didn't know LaTeX at all. So pretty much, my team really carried me for the project. I tried my best, and as long as they told me what I had to do, I tried to do it. Now that I'm older and a little bit wiser, I'm going to try and build one on my own...hopefully. I'm pretty much going to follow what we did in the class, and hopefully I'm able to get this thing done/working (I've already started working on the API). Since I have this high interest in ancient greek culture, the app is going to model greek mythology. It will have Gods, Titans, Heros, and maybe beast. I might even show it off to my old mythology professor, although I don't know if she'll understand the significance of me actually building the app.

Sorry this is a super long update, but there was a lot to update on...

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
