===========

Like I said in my last post, I'm going to try and stick with C++ and Python for my coding challenges. Well, I haven't found a real simple IDE to use for C++ on my mac. I do have XCode, but I don't really need all the features for something as simple as doing a coding challenge and where I'll primarily be using the main function. I want something similar to CodeRunner, but able to handle syntax errors and such. So I'm going to look into CLion by jetbrains over christmas break. I guess it's sort of in Beta right now, because they only have this Early Access Program, where you try their pre-release version, and I think you only get access to it for 30 days. So that's why I'm waiting till I go home for Christmas, so I can make the most out of those 30days. If I don't like CLion, you'll most likely see a review before Christmas. If it's doing OK, you'll probably get see my review closer to mid January.

Well until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
