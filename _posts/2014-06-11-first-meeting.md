title: First meeting and other updates
----

We had our first group meeting today for the business contracts (from now on, called BC). We just did a lot of talking and tried to get subversion control working with the software we're using. The team leader worked on it last night and we worked on it for about an hour today, but we just couldn't get it working. So, we're just going to use git; although some of the features for the subversion control looked pretty cool. For instance, you could compare the changes made in the model (just like merging code but with the actual data model). I also started to update my github.io page, and when I say update, I really mean start from scratch. The code was kind of a mess with my little knowledge of HTML and CSS when I made it; there were like 4 or 5 nested divs, and div was pretty much the only element used. I also had this attraction to boxes, so pretty much everything was boxed and very myspace esque.

I also kind of started work back on the Outdoor Center Database (OCDB). I realized a somewhat important feature I was missing when talking with a co-worker the other day, which was a way to take inventory of all items on the shelf. I started to try and implement it today and realized that it's either impossible or will be very, very difficult to implement and I would probably have to restructure the whole model and restart the whole APEX web application.

Well, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night where ever you may be!
