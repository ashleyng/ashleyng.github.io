===========

Sorry for the lack of updates...again. I pretty much took a two week vacation. I didn't really do much actual work, but I realized that second summer session is coming up in like a week so I've been buckling down to get things for my proctoring job done. Also been working on the JavaScript Murach book when I'm taking a break from my proctoring stuff. But small update on that, this book has been really slow going for me. I don't know why. I just haven't enjoyed it or going though it as fast as the HTML one.

The UTBC project has been moving kind of slow, but it makes sense because we only meet for about an hour and a half twice a week. We've finally completed the model and wil now start our work in Oracle's Application Express Early Access 2 (or APEX 5.2 for short). It's still in its trial period, but the actual product should be released soon.

Cheers,

Good morning, good afternoon, good evening and good night
