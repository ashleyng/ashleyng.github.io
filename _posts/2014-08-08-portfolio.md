============

I've currently stopped working on the Greek Mythology application and moved towards building my portfolio page in the same manner. I think it's coming along very nicely, but I had asked reddit if doing this would be appealing to employers. Even though only one person answered my post, they said they thought it was too much. It probably is too much, but I'm still really drawn to the idea. So even if I decided to  just use my github.io page, I can put the dynamic portfolio application on that portfolio.

Just a short little update. So until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
