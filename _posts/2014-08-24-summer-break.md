title: Summer break
---

Sorry I've been absent lately; I've been on my "Summer" break. I finished proctoring and grading finals on Wednesday, and was super busy before that  with helping with the students with their class projects. So now I'm just enjoying what is left of my summer before classes start on Wednesday. I'm kind of excited to start learning again, but yet still dreading it.

Tomorrow add/drop opens up again, and I think I'm going to get out of data visualization/warehousing and get into 3D reconstruction and computer vision. I think the visualization class will be a lot easier, but I'm super interesting in the computer vision class. My biggest concern is the workload because I'll be taking algorithms this semester. Hopefully I'll be able to handle my class load and still be able to go workout. I've been swimming a lot lately just to stay fit, and I've made so much progress over the summer that I hope I can keep up with it over the fall semester. Hopefully since I quit my normal job at the gym I'll have time to do all of this.

I kind of temporarily stopped working on projects, just so I can enjoy my break. I'm also kind of tired of looking at SQL and APEX since proctoring. I need to take a break from it before I can finish up my other projects. As for the UTBC project, that is as complete as we can get it in the time we have. We pretty much finished with it on Monday. There's still some things that aren't prefect or complete, but all the core features are there. Just had the thought that I should probably go export the application in case Oracle wipes the workspace when they migrate to the full version of APEX 5.

I'm going to go back and be lazy, watch television, and enjoy my summer (oh and go watch the new episode of Doctor Who).

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
