Sorry It's been awhile, just a lot going with intern events and then just being tired after work. But the internship is going great. I love it! The people and the work environment is just amazing. I'm not really sure how much I can talk about what I work on since my squad is fairly new, but maybe in a few weeks time.

Other than work, since I don't really have anything else to do,  I was working on a simple iOS app with a [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) backend. Just to understand the Firebase's API, get familiar with retrieving, sending, and altering data and uploading images to the database. All it really is is a table view, a form, and a details view of each entry. I might post the project on github if I can figure out how to add users (so you can play with your own data and not a global database) or just might give out the json file and you just make your own firebase app for it. I might even try making this app on a Parse backend so you see the comparison between the two.

Other than that, haven't been doing much else. Might be going to a 'Celebrate Lincoln' festival later to day with the other interns.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
