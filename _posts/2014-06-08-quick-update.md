================

Sorry for the lack of updates recently. I just got back into town for summer school/work a few days ago and I'm in the middle of preparing my apartment to have laminate floors installed.

I may do a review on a few of my EDC items in the next couple of days, just to make up for the lack of updates.

Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night where ever you may be!
