title: First class day
---

Hello to the start of my 5th year in college! The first class day is done and over, and overall it went pretty well. Got out early in 2 of the 3 classes today. My first class today was a classical civilizations class, Topography and Monuments of Ancient Rome to be exact. It's a really small class, only 12 people, and as a liberal arts class, there will be a lot of reading...yay... We will also have a research paper and presentation, which I haven't done for a few years, so that should be an interesting and fun experience. I also had my C++ language class, as well as Intro Into Computer Security. The Security class should be an interesting one since it's being taught a bit differently. It's kind of an online based class, but not self paced. All the lectures are pre-recorded and we're suppose to watch them on our own, and the scheduled lecture times are more for questions and answers on the material.

Tomorrow I have 3D reconstruction and computer vision, algorithms, and Data visualization. I had mention in an earlier post that I had dropped visualization for comp. vision, but I'm still kind of undecided as to which I want to actually take. So, I'll be attending both for the first few days till I make my official decision (of course, before add/drop ends).  I've already started reading the textbook for comp. vision, and there's a lot of matrix stuff that I need to refresh on.

Overall, this semester will consist of a lot of coding, but I guess that's normal for a computer science major.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
