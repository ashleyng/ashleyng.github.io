title: First week of class
---

First week is over (although it was technically only 4 days). But I'm looking forward to the semester and my classes. I'm currently taking Operating Systems, iOS development, a JavaScript language course, and an Objective C language course. I know OS will be difficult and time consuming, but I feel ok about it right now (no doubt, I'll probably be writing a hysterical post about that class later on in the semester about how much I hate it).

I think I'm most excited about the iOS and Obj. - C courses. The iOS class will be inObj. - C, not Swift, so it may seem kind of weird that I'm taking both, but I needed thatObj. - C course to be a full time student. But I think it could only benefit me in getting more practice since I might be addingObj. - C, and later on Swift, to my preferred languages if I'm really serious about iOS development. May even take out Python to focus more on Swift. As for the JS class, I think it's good to have some knowledge of JS, but at this point, I definitely do not intended to add it to my list of preferred languages since I'm kind of moving away from wanting to do web dev.

Side note: Got an email newsletter from O'Reilly, and they posted a link to a mashable.com article on "15 programming languages you need to know in 2015". From briefly looking at the article, I still think I've make a good decision in my languages. And spoiler alert: Swift made the cut!

Until next time, Good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
