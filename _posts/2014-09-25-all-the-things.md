===========

Well just got done with a C++ assignment, and I have a lot on my mind at the moment so this might end up being word vomit.

First off, turned in my very first internship application! Would of turned in more today, but I have to write up a cover letter for them as well as get transcripts for others. I also finished the computer vision project on Monday. Didn't get as much extra credit done as I'd like, but we at least did some of it. I may try and work on it separately to get the image blending and spherical projection implemented (which were both part of the extra credit). It seems easy enough, but trying to figure out how to use OpenCVs functions is the problem.

I also just purchased Big Nerd Ranch's Objective-C and iOS Programming books, as well as download Apple's (free) Swift books. So I think you can see where this is headed; I want to try and get into iOS app development. I already tried it once through one of the ITunesU courses, but didn't finish it. Hopefully I'll have more success with this book. But honestly though, this Objective-C books might of been pointless to buy, so far it's pretty much everything I already knew or learned from my C++ class. But then again, I'm not even a quarter of the way through, so maybe I'll learn something later on.

Next, I've realized that I need to change my pythonanywhere site, which is pretty much my portfolio site if you didn't already know. It's pretty ugly and hard to navigate for the amount of information I have on it. Also, I really need to get my own domain...

Next, I've been working through Cracking the Coding Interview book. Not very far in though. Out of the one's I've done, the questions are simple enough, but my solutions are nowhere as efficient as they should be or as the answers are. Which will probably bite my in the ass during interviews if I don't work on it. Another helpful site is reddit's daily programming subreddit. Although I haven't had time to actually go and try it out, they have a whole bunch of programs to go practice on. The subreddit does at least three challenges a week, a beginner, intermediate, and advanced challenge. I think there's at least a 150 of each.

As you can see, I have a lot I want/need to do, but don't have the time. Or maybe I just need to completely cutout youtube videos, SVU, and football games from my life.............nah.

Well off to bed now, until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night.
