============

We are now half way through the 2nd week of summer session 2, and it is hectic now. With grading and the Business Contract  project it's like none stop work. I'm actually about to go work on the BC project because we need to get some features working before Tuesday because we're actually going to be presenting it to the class I'm proctoring for.

Well this was a short little update.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
