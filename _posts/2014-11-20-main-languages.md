Coming to an end of my 9th semester at university (5th year student), I've realized I need to start thinking about what area I want to go in and kind of stick to it at this point. Also with (hopefully) a lot of coding challenges from companies in the near future, I need just stick to a language to use on them and just practice with the language (which is the topic of this post).

I've kind of narrowed it down to either c++ and/or python. The reason for my choices is 1) I just took a c++ class. 2) Python is super easy, except for the fact I don't know how to OO in python (hopefully the python class will be offered again before I graduate). 3) You're probably thinking I'm crazy for choosing these and not java. The reason behind me not choosing java is I haven't coded in it extensively in a VERY LONG time. The last class I took in java was my data structures class which was Fall 2012, and then I finally used java again this semester for computer security (but it's not as intensive as data structures). So, about 2 year of no practice with Java, and I think that's all that needs to be said about why I didn't choose Java.

Now, I'm registered for a class(Software Design) next semester that will be in Java, and I'm not entirely sure I should stay in for this reason. I think the class in generally will be super helpful, but it being in java is really turning me away. I'm also registered for a javascript class that I'm also iffy about, but I think it would be helpful if I decided to go into web dev/front end dev. We'll just have to wait and see come the first class day of the spring semester

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!
