Sometimes we think life isn't fair. We put some much work into achieving something, but get no results. You just have to keep moving on. The one thing I truly believe in is that everything happens for a reason. Just because you didn't get that job offer or get accepted to your school of choice, isn't the world against you. If anything it is helping guide you to where you need to be, but that also doesn't mean that you should give up on that dream. You can work harder at it, and if it's meant to happen, it will happen.

This sort of leads me to the question, "What do I want to be when I grow up". When I was younger, I would of told you a vet. But just five years ago, I would of told you I wanted to be an mechanical engineer at NASA. When I first applied to UT, I didn't get accepted into the engineering program, so I had to go in as undeclared. But that was ok, I was going to my school of choice, and I could just transfer in after my first year. Wrong! It didn't become apparent to me how competitive the engineering school was (and how hard college was) till it was time to actually apply for a major. The average GPA for out state students in the engineering school was a 4.0 (in state was 3.8-3.9). And because my school didn't prepare me for college, my GPA was low. Definitely not enough to even get into the engineering program with the lowest GPA requirement. My next thought was, what degrees would prepare me most to be an engineer? That was when I declared physics, and a few month later I thought it would look better to get the computer science elements certificate. And that is when everything changed. The first 'Hello World' program just blew my mind. I can't even put into words at how amazing I thought it was. I later decided to double major in physics and computer science, but later dropping the physics degree (which is a whole other story). Here I am now, working on creating an operating system and iOS applications. But I think the one thing that lead me here was that I didn't get into the engineering program and I didn't give up on the dream. So I tried for the next best thing, but then found something better.

Everything happens for a reason. If it's meant to happen, it will happen, but that doesn't mean you should give up on your dreams. Just because one door closes doesn't mean another one won't open further down the line.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
