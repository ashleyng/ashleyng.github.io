I started back up on some of my computer vision projects this past weekend. One in particular was the mosaic and panoramic image stitcher. I had been stuck for some time on the image blending portion, but I had a break through this past weekend. I first tested it out with just two images and simple splitting them in half and blending the two halves. After a few hours yesterday (Monday) of adding code in to test it with a larger amount of images as well as trying to blend the correct areas, turns out I don't have enough resources/memory on my computer to run the program -_-, even with just 3 photos. So I have no idea if my program actually works because it gets killed right before the last step of the blending algorithm. So it looks like I'll be trying to move that whole code base over to c++ to see if that does it any good with using explicit memory management. Well, I guess it was bound to happen that I had to move c++ from python for this vision stuff.

Until next time, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, and good night
